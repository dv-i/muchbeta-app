She wasn’t entirely wrong, but I didn’t think of myself as a depressed person. I was a cancer kid. It wasn’t depression; it was just reality. The support group met in the basement of a church in a room shaped like a cross. The leader, Patrick, was a survivor, which meant he spent a lot of time talking about the miracle of his survival. Most of us were just trying to get through each meeting without rolling our eyes too obviously.

Then Augustus Waters walked in.

He was tall, impossibly good-looking, and had the kind of confidence that made the rest of us seem like shadows of people. He only had one leg, the other lost to osteosarcoma, but he moved with an ease that suggested he wasn’t weighed down by his illness.

He caught me staring and grinned.

"What?" I asked.

"You’re just so… interesting," he said, his blue eyes holding mine.

I wasn’t sure whether to be flattered or annoyed.

That was the beginning of Augustus Waters and me. And, as it turned out, the beginning of everything.`,

		preview: `Mr. Jones, the owner of Manor Farm, forgot to lock the henhouse properly again. He had stumbled to bed hours earlier, drunk on beer, unaware that his animals were stirring with restless energy.

In the great barn, they gathered. The pigs, the smartest of them all, sat at the front, while the horses, cows, sheep, and other animals crowded behind. At the center stood Old Major, the wise and aging boar, his eyes gleaming with conviction.

"Comrades," he began, his deep voice commanding silence, "our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We toil, we suffer, and when we are no longer useful, we are cast aside. But why? Because Man is our enemy. He takes without giving. He consumes without producing. Remove Man, and we shall be free!"

A murmur spread through the barn, growing into an excited roar. Freedom. No masters. No whips. No hunger.

That night, as the animals drifted to sleep, a dream took root in their minds—a dream of a farm run by animals, for animals. A dream of revolution.

They did not yet know how soon their chance would come. Nor did they foresee what their rebellion would cost them.`,

“This,” the shopkeeper whispered, “is no ordinary trinket.”

Celeste glanced up at the old woman. The shop had been hidden away in an alley she had never noticed before, its wooden sign worn smooth by time. Inside, it smelled of aged paper and forgotten things.

“What does it do?” she asked.

The woman smiled, her silver eyes glinting. “It shows the truth.”

Celeste frowned. “Truth?”

“Hold it to your heart,” the woman said.

Hesitant, Celeste pressed the butterfly to her chest. A cold shock ran through her veins. The world around her flickered, as if reality had cracked like glass.

And then she saw them.

Ghostly figures, standing just behind the shopkeeper, their faces blurred, their lips moving in silent words. A thousand whispers filled the air. The candlelight dimmed, and shadows stretched long against the walls.

Celeste gasped and dropped the butterfly.

The moment it hit the floor, the visions vanished.

The shopkeeper only smiled. “Once you’ve seen the truth, child, there is no unseeing it.”

Celeste backed toward the door.

But outside, the city was no longer the one she had left.

And the butterfly, though shattered, still glowed faintly in the dark.`,

Lena adjusted the filtration mask over her face and scanned the horizon. The air was toxic here, thick with the remnants of a war no one remembered. The old maps were useless—oceans had dried, mountains had crumbled, and what remained was nothing but wasteland.

Except for the Tower.

It stood at the edge of the dead city, impossibly tall, untouched by time. A relic from before the Fall. And, if the stories were true, the last place on Earth where knowledge still remained.

Lena had spent her life searching for it.

The others had called her a fool. The Elders claimed the past was better left buried. But she had seen the old records—whispers of a time when the planet was green, when humans ruled instead of hid. And she wanted to know why it had all gone wrong.

A low growl echoed across the wasteland.

She wasn’t alone.

Lena tightened her grip on her knife and stepped forward. Whatever secrets the Tower held, she would uncover them.

Or die trying.`,

Elena moved carefully, her footsteps barely making a sound against the polished marble floors. The paintings loomed around her, their oil-brushed figures frozen in time, eyes that seemed to watch, to judge, to whisper.

She paused in front of The Lady in Red, the museum’s most famous piece. It was an 18th-century portrait of a woman in a crimson gown, her lips curved in an unreadable smile. Elena had seen it a hundred times, but tonight, under the dim security lights, something was different.

The woman had shifted.

Elena’s breath caught in her throat. It was impossible. Paintings didn’t change. And yet, the Lady’s eyes—once cast downward—were staring directly at her.

She took a step back, her heart hammering. The whispers began, soft at first, curling through the air like mist. Not voices, not exactly, but something just beyond hearing. She turned quickly, expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows.

No one.

The gallery was empty.

She swallowed, forcing herself to look at the painting again. The Lady in Red’s smile had grown wider.

And then she blinked.

Elena ran.

But as she reached the doors, the whispers turned into a single voice—smooth, knowing, and right behind her ear.

"Why are you running?"`,
